# startng-html-task
My first Startng task to be be pushed to Github

Also,  here's  link to my Lucid article where I talk about the things I've learnt so far during the Startng internship program; https://lucid.blog/nefejames1/post/1566414581

I also made out a tweet to Flutterwave for collaborating with HNG and STARTNG as sponsors of the internship. You can find that here https://twitter.com/nefe_james/status/1164253628070338561?s=20
